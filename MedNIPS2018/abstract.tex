This paper describes our approach for the ISIC Challenge 2018 - Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection. For Part 1 - Lesion Segmentation, we developed a U-Net based convolutional neural network pretrained with the ImageNet dataset and applied several data augmentation and hyperparameters optimization strategies, obtaining threshold Jaccard index of 77.5\%. For Part 3 - Lesion Classification, we developed an ensemble strategy that achieved an 84.6\% accuracy, which is in the upper bound of human specialists performance range.
